mate-builder
============

Building MATE desktop from scratch made easy.

mate-builder is a shell script that builds and installs MATE Desktop (http://www.mate-desktop.org/).

Intended audience:
------------------
1) Not for end-users.

Don't use this script if you are a 'normal' user of MATE Desktop.
If you want to run MATE Destkop on your system, you should use the package manager of your Linux distribution or install Linux Mint MATE Edition (http://www.linuxmint.com/).

2) Developers.

Don't use this if you just want to submit a patch for a MATE component.
In this case, you can install development packages from your distribution and follow instructions from the wiki (http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/).

3) Packagers.

Packagers have the required knowledge to build packages for their distributions.
They don't need this ;)

Warning:
--------
Don't use that on a production system or on your everyday system.
Use this script only on a test machine or in a virtual machine.
